# This class provides definitions for API routes and endpoints for the file_links namespace. It inherits the
# functionality from the Grape REST API framework. It is mounted in lib/api/v3/work_packages/work_packages_api.rb,
# which puts the file_links namespace behind the provided namespace of the work packages api
# -> /api/v3/work_packages/:id/file_links/...
